# Android music player

Android application for uploading songs and streaming them from an http server. I made it so I didn't have to clutter my phone's storage with large songs. Requires [nodejs server](https://github.com/import-username/music-player-server) for uploading/streaming songs, authentication, etc.

## Installation

Clone application and install to your phone or emulator.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/import-username/android-music-player.git
```
